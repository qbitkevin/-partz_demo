  The StaticText component allows you to create a text box that is readOnly and gets its
  value from a different location

inherits:
  ref: ni8nii

props:

  - name: "value"
    type: "string | object | array | number"
    restriction: "Value | null"
    required: true
    fallback: undefined
    description: >
      The value prop should usually be a string but can also be sent an object, a number or an array. If sent a string,
      it inputs the string as the value of the text box, if it is an object, it will look to return value.description,
      value.label or value.name and if those don't exist, will call toString on the object, number, or array. If value 
      is null or undefined, returns empty string. Note: the demo only accepts strings currently, but implementation has
      full support.

  - name: "css"
    type: "string"
    restriction: "string | undefined"
    required: false
    fallback: undefined

      Allows for a class name to be placed on the specific TextCo.
